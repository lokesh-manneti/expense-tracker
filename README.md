Building a Personal Finance Tracker with Google Cloud SQL

Introduction | Overview
Building a modern web application can seem like a daunting task, especially for beginners. This blog will guide you through the process of developing a user-friendly web app from concept to completion. Our target audience includes developers with a basic understanding of programming concepts and an interest in web development. By the end of this blog, you will have the knowledge and tools necessary to create a simple yet functional web application.
Core Components of the Web Application
•	Front-end User Interface (UI): Built using React for a dynamic and responsive user experience.
•	Back-end Server: Powered by Java Spring Boot to handle API requests and business logic.
•	Database: Cloud SQL for efficient and scalable relational data storage.
•	Storage: Google Cloud Storage bucket for profile photo storage and static assets.
•	Analytics and Chat: Integration of Gemini 2.0 for chat and analytics functionalities.
This design allows for a modular, maintainable, and scalable application that can be updated with new features as needed. The use of cloud services ensures high availability and easy scalability.
Software & Tools
•	Java Development Kit (JDK): Download here
•	Spring Boot CLI: Download here
•	Node.js: Download here
•	React: Installed using Node Package Manager (npm)
•	IDE: Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, or Eclipse
Basic Knowledge Required
•	Familiarity with Java and Spring Boot
•	Understanding of REST APIs
•	Basic knowledge of React (for the front end)
________________________________________
Step 2: Create a New Spring Boot Project
1.	Open your terminal or command prompt.
2.	Use Spring Initializr to create a new project by running:
spring init --dependencies=web,data-jpa,cloud-sql --build=gradle my_first_app
3.	Navigate to the project folder:
cd my_first_app
4.	Open the project in your IDE.
________________________________________
Step 3: Build the Back-end
1.	Create the necessary REST controllers and services in the src/main/java directory.
2.	Use JPA annotations to define your database models and connect to Cloud SQL.
3.	Test your API endpoints using tools like Postman or cURL.
 
________________________________________
 

Step 4: Create the Front-end with React
1.	In a new terminal, navigate to the desired directory and create a new React project:
npx create-react-app my-frontend
2.	Navigate to the project folder:
cd my-frontend
3.	Start the development server:
npm start
4.	Create components, pages, and routes for your application using React.
 
________________________________________
Step 5: Deploy the Application to Google Cloud Run
1.	Containerize the Spring Boot back-end and React front-end using Docker.
2.	Push the Docker images to Google Container Registry (GCR).
3.	Deploy the application using Google Cloud Run:
gcloud run deploy
4.	Monitor and test the deployment using the provided URL.
________________________________________
Step 6: Integrate Gemini 2.0, Cloud SQL, and Cloud Storage
1.	Connect to Gemini 2.0 to add chat and analytics capabilities.
2.	Store user profile photos in Cloud Storage and update the app to display profile images.
3.	Use Cloud SQL to manage relational data and ensure the back-end has proper data connections.

Result / Demo
At the end of this project, you will have a fully functional web application with the following features:
•	User-friendly interface using React for dynamic pages and responsiveness.
•	API-powered back-end using Spring Boot and connected to Cloud SQL.
•	Cloud-hosted storage with Cloud Storage to store and retrieve user profile photos.
•	Advanced capabilities like real-time chat and analytics, thanks to Gemini 2.0.
Your final app should be available via a public URL, accessible from any device.
